univariate analysis:

Boxplots of Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income are within valid range, so no invalid was entered within the data

My interpretation from univariate analysis:
Our analysis reveals significant income disparity among applicants. While the average income appears to be $5,400, this figure is inflated by a small number of very wealthy applicants. The 'typical' (median) applicant actually earns roughly $3,800. We adjusted our model to ensure these wealthy outliers do not skew the predictions for the typical customer
